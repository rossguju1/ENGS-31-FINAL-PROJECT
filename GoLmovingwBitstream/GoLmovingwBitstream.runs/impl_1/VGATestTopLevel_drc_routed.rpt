2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net GameController/new_r_addr_reg[12]_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin GameController/new_r_addr_reg[12]_i_1/O, cell GameController/new_r_addr_reg[12]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net GameController/old_r_addr_reg[12]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin GameController/old_r_addr_reg[12]_i_2/O, cell GameController/old_r_addr_reg[12]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net GameController/old_w_data_reg_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin GameController/old_w_data_reg_i_1/O, cell GameController/old_w_data_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net GameController/position_reg[12]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin GameController/position_reg[12]_i_2/O, cell GameController/position_reg[12]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net timing/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin timing/register_position_reg[12]_i_2/O, cell timing/register_position_reg[12]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

RTSTAT-10#1 Warning
No routable loads  
1 net(s) have no routable loads. The problem bus(es) and/or net(s) are new_state/U0/inst_blk_mem_gen/gnbram.gnativebmg.native_blk_mem_gen/valid.cstr/ramloop[0].ram.r/ENA_dly_reg_D.
